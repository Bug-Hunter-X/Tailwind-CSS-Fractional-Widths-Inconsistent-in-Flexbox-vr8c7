# Tailwind CSS Fractional Widths Inconsistent in Flexbox

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue with Tailwind CSS's fractional width classes when used within a flexbox container.  The problem arises when the content within the flex items has differing sizes, causing the fractional widths to behave unexpectedly and not split the available space equally.

The `bug.html` file shows the problem. The `solution.html` provides a fix, utilizing techniques to ensure equal width distribution regardless of content size.  See the README for details on how to resolve this issue.
